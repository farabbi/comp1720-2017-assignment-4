# Artist Statement

## Why did you choose the dataset(s) you ended up using?
I am really interested in students' attitudes towards learning. After reading the data, I am curious about the average attitudes of students towards questions. Although the properties of the objects are hard to use, I decided to make the data visible.

## What story are you trying to tell with the data?
In China, people always compare education to marathon. They always say "Don't let your children lose on the start line." or "If you don't run, others will leave you back." or something else. So I make the background look like a running track in such a survey about education attitudes. Different questions mark as different runners, which are black dots. The more students agree with the question, the further the black dot will be.

## How have made your work dynamic and/or interactive?
I made the process of counting dynamic, and the details of questions interactive. Because the amount of records is large, the process of counting takes a period of time. If I keep the screen freezing, it will be too boring. So I dynamically presented the process of counting as the movement of the black dots. There are also three lines to show the degree of the attitudes towards questions. If you move your mouse on the agree part or disagree part, the background will tell you which part it is. If you move your mouse on a black dot, a big black dot will appear. It will tell you more details about the feedback towards the question.

## What do you want the viewer to tell their friends about the data after they?ve seen your sketch?
Different people have different focus points on a graph of survey. Some people will focus on the extreme points like the question people agree most or the question people disagree most. Some people will focus on the questions which have their interested key words like high-salary jobs. I want the viewer to memorise the results that they are interested in, and tell their friends something like "Most people believe ...".
